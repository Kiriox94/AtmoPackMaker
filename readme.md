# Description
AtmoPackMaker is a project aimed at enabling anyone to create their own custom Atmosphere pack that updates automatically.

# Installation
## Fork
To allow you to have your pack based on this template, I use [GitHub's fork system](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo). To create your fork, [go here](https://github.com/Kiriox94/AtmoPackMaker/fork), and fill in the various options as you see fit. Make sure to leave "Copy the main branch only" checked. Now that you have your own fork of the project, I recommend you follow the rest of the tutorial from there.

### Tip
To always have the latest version of the project, remember to click on the "Sync fork" button from time to time to check for updates.\

## Configuration

### PACK_NAME
To select the name of your pack, you need to use [GitHub's variable system](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/variables). To do this, [go here](/settings/variables/actions/new), and in the `name` field, put `PACK_NAME`, then put the name you want to give to your pack in the `value` field.

### localFiles
If you want to include files in your pack that don't need to be downloaded, you can simply place them in the [`localFiles`](/localFiles) folder, the contents of which will be copied to the root of the SD card.

### config.json
The main configuration is done with the [`config.json`](/config.json) file, which allows you to configure several things.

- `language` represents the language you want to use to display console logs (list of all available languages accessible [here](/translation.csv)).

- `repoLink` represents the path to your repository where the project is, for example `Kiriox94/AtmoPackMaker` (if your pack is on a branch other than the main one, specify it like this: `Kiriox94/AtmoPackMaker/tree/Eevee-Pack`). By default, this value is automatically retrieved, so there is no need to specify it unless there is a special case (if your pack is on a branch other than the main one, for example).

- `useAIO` represents whether you want to include [aio-switch-updater](https://github.com/HamletDuFromage/aio-switch-updater) in the pack, allowing you to update the pack directly from your switch.

- `startuplogoPath` represents the path to a `.png` file of size 308x350 that replaces the Nintendo Switch logo at startup (leave blank if you don't want to replace the startup icon).

- `splashscreenPath` represents the path to a `.png` file of size 1280x720 that replaces the Atmosphere splash screen when launching the `fusee.bin` payload (leave blank if you don't want to replace the `fusee.bin` splash screen).

- `githubFiles` represents the files you want to have the latest version downloaded directly from GitHub. Each element of the array represents a different GitHub repo, and each must have these properties:
    - `link` represents the GitHub path of the repository, for example, for GoldLeaf: `XorTroll/Goldleaf`
    - `desiredFiles` is also an array representing all the files you want to be downloaded from the latest release of the repo. Here are the available properties:
        - `filename` represents the name the file will have once downloaded.
        - `directory` represents the path on the SD card where you want your file to be placed. For example, for a homebrew, just put `switch` to place it in the right folder (leave blank if you want it placed at the root).
        - `exp` represents the name of the file you want to retrieve from the release in the form of a [regular expression](https://www.empirik.fr/nos-ressources/article/expressions-regulieres-ou-regex-definition-cas-dusages-et-exemples/), handy if the filename changes with versions. For example, to download the correct file on the Atmosphere release: `/^atmosphere-(\d+(\.\d+))((\.\d+))-[a-zA-Z]+-[a-zA-Z0-9]+\+hbl-[0-9]*\.[0-9]+[0-9]*\.[0-9]+\+hbmenu-[0-9]*\.[0-9]+[0-9]*\.[0-9]+\.zip$/` (if nothing is specified, it will be generated automatically from the `filename` property).

- `onlineFiles` represents the files you want to download via a link. Each element of the array represents a different file, and each must have these properties:
    - `name` represents the name the file will have once downloaded.
    - `url` represents the URL from which your file will be downloaded.
    - `directory` represents the path on the SD card where you want your file to be placed. For example, for a homebrew, just put `switch` to place it in the right folder (leave blank if you want it placed at the root).
         
# Compilation
To easily compile the pack, I use [GitHub's workflow system](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/about-workflows). To enable it, go to [the `actions` section](/actions) of your repository, and click on the blue button.\

## Automatic
Allows triggering the compilation of the pack directly from your switch. This option is still in development, please refer to the manual system in the meantime.

## Manual
### Compile And Release
`Compile And Release` allows you to compile the pack and then publish it in a release. To do this, go [here](/actions/workflows/releaseOnTag.yml) and click on `Run workflow`. Then specify the version number you want for your release (be careful, two releases cannot have the same version number, as it would create an error). Finally, click on the blue `Run workflow` button. All that's left is to wait for the process to finish.
### Just Compile
`Just Compile` allows you to compile the pack without publishing a release afterward. It can be useful if you want to see if your configuration works well without making a version. To do this, go [here](/actions/workflows/node.js.yml) and click on `Run workflow`, then once again on `Run workflow`. All that's left is to wait for the process to finish.
